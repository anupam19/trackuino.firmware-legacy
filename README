IF YOU DOWNLAODED THE trackuino-ide-* PACKAGE:
===============================================

  1. Unzip the package into your Arduino sketches folder.
  2. Locate the "libraries/config/config.h" file and replace settings
     with your own (YOUR CALLSIGN GOES THERE).
  3. Open up the IDE, locate the trackuino.pde sketch, compile.
  4. Done

  Note; The "eagle" folder contains the Eagle schematic files and libraries

  How to compile
  --------------

  1. Edit Makefile.user, replace settings with your own
  2. Edit src/config.h, replace settings with your own
  3. cd src
  4. make

  How to flash
  ------------

  1. Connect the Arduino to the USB port
  2. cd src
  3. make upload

  Other useful commands
  ---------------------

  - 'cd src; make lss': creates the assembler listing file
  - 'cd src; make clean': cleans project files
  - 'cd lib; make': builds just the library (libarduino.a)

  How were the Arduino libs imported
  ----------------------------------

  The lib/ directory contains the Arduino libraries, with some of the files
  shuffled around so that the source tree looks cleaner (ie. separation
  between .c/.cpp and .h). The tracker only needs the Wire and Core libs,
  everything else is included so that the whole tree can be used as a
  template for a different project.

  This is what I did to import the Arduino libs, in case they need to be
  upgraded:

  0. Installed Arduino (current libs are from version 017)
  1. copied $ARDUINO_DIR/hardware/cores/arduino/* to lib/Core
  2. copied -r $ARDUINO_DIR/hardware/libraries/ to lib/
  3. mkdir include
  4. find lib/ -name "*.h" -exec mv "{}" include/ \;
  5. removed compilation erros resulting from file re-shuffling, mainly:
    * mismatching #include <utility/...> / <...> in the Wire and Ethernet
      libraries
  6. replaced <avr/delay.h> with <util/delay.h> to remove a few warnings
