How to import the Arduino libraries from the IDE
------------------------------------------------

1. copy core lib to lib/Core
2. copy all other libs to lib/*
3. mkdir include
4. find lib/ -name "*.h" -exec mv "{}" include/ \;
5. try 'make' and remove compilation erros as they come, mainly:
  * mismatching #include <utility/...> / <...> in the Wire and Ethernet libraries
6. optionally replace <avr/delay.h> with <util/delay.h> to remove some a few warnings
